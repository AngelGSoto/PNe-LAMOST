Abstract:
    The post-asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase is arguably one of the
    least understood phases of the evolution of low- and intermediate-
    mass stars. The two grids of models presently available are based on
    outdated micro- and macrophysics and do not agree with each other.
    Studies of the central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNe) and post-AGB
    stars in different stellar populations point to significant
    discrepancies with the theoretical predictions of post-AGB models.

    We study the timescales of post-AGB and CSPNe in the context of our
    present understanding of the micro- and macrophysics of stars. We want
    to assess whether new post-AGB models, based on the latter
    improvements in TP-AGB modeling, can help us to understand the
    discrepancies between observation and theory and within theory itself.
    In addition, we aim to understand the impact of the previous AGB
    evolution for post-AGB phases.

    We computed a grid of post-AGB full evolutionary sequences that
    include all previous evolutionary stages from the zero age main
    sequence to the white dwarf phase. We computed models for initial
    masses between 0.8 and 4M_{sun}_ and for a wide range of initial
    metallicities (Z_0_= 0.02, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001). This allowed us to
    provide post-AGB timescales and properties for H-burning post-AGB
    objects with masses in the relevant range for the formation of
    planetary nebulae (~0,5-0,8M_{sun}_). We included an updated treatment
    of the constitutive microphysics and included an updated description
    of the mixing processes and winds that play a key role during the
    thermal pulses (TP) on the AGB phase.

Description:
    We compute a grid of post-AGB full evolutionary sequences that are
    derived from full evolutionary models which include all previous
    evolutionary stages from the Zero Age Main Sequence to the White Dwarf
    phase. Models are computed for initial masses between 0.8 and
    4M_{sun}_ and for a wide range of initial metallicities. Two grids of
    post-AGB models are provided. The main grid of 24 H-burning post-AGB
    sequences corresponds to the sequences presented in table 3 of the
    article. Each file contains all the sequences with a given initial
    metallicity and are named as 0200_T03.dat, 0100_T03.dat 0010_T03.dat
    and 0001_T03.dat (corresponding to metallicities Z=0.02, 0.01, 0.001
    and 0.0001 in table 3).

    The second grid corresponds to the sequences presented in Appendix B,
    table B.2 (originally presented in Miller Bertolami, M. M. 2015, in
    ASPCS, Vol. 493, 83) and are named as 0100_TB2.dat and 0010_TB2.dat
    (corresponding to metallicities Z=0.01 and 0.001 in table B2)

    All sequences are presented at equivalent evolutionary points to allow
    easy interpolation:

    Sequences are presented until their luminosity drops to 1 solar
    luminosity or until a late helium flash develops.
